# Smart Energy Monitor (Tinkercad Simulation)

## Overview
This project simulates a Smart Energy Monitoring system using Arduino and Tinkercad.
Instead of real voltage/current sensors, potentiometers are used to emulate readings.

## Features
- Simulates voltage and current measurements.
- Calculates power (W) and energy consumption (Wh).
- Displays real-time data on Serial Monitor and 16x2 LCD.
- Easy to upgrade with real sensors like ACS712 & ZMPT101B.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD
- 2x Potentiometers (simulation)
- Breadboard, jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
(Include your Tinkercad screenshot here)

## How to Run
1. Open Tinkercad and create a new circuit.
2. Add the components listed above.
3. Wire them according to `SmartEnergyMonitor_Tinkercad.ino`.
4. Upload the code and start simulation.

## Future Upgrades
- Replace potentiometers with real ACS712 & ZMPT101B sensors.
- Add Wi-Fi module to upload data to cloud.
- Implement relay-based device control.
